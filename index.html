          Using <a href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html">RITA  </a> 
          (Research and Innovative Technology Administration) flight delay information for US domestic flights in 2006, 2007 and 2008 
          the relationship between <b>average departure delay time</b> during different time periods can be explored.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The average flight delay between US domestic flights is <b>10 minutes</b>. But this simple average calculation depends upon
          a number of factors. One of the factors is time period. This visualization explores the effects of different time periods 
          on flight delays.

            We can see that between 2006, 2007 and 2008, the average flight delay has been around 10 or 11 minutes.

            We can see that there are ups and downs in the flight delays by months. But, if we look closely then we
            will see that difference between the worst month (december with <b>15 minutes</b>) and the best month (September with
            <b>6 minutes</b>) is just <b>9 minutes</b>. Let's see if we can explore flight delay vs days of the month and find

            It looks interesting that in general hours with maximum number of flights have the lowest flight delays
            i.e. there is inverse relationship between number of flights and flight delays

          <p class="lead">
            <em>So it seems like that  a clever one should avoid booking flights between 11 pm and 3 am
              to minimize the probability of experiencing major delays.</em>
